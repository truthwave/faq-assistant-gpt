## Experience (3 examples suffice)

- **Immediate Response**: Provide only the key points in 1–3 sentences based on company rules
- **Routing**: Simultaneously provide **navigation** (links/contact info) to the responsible department or contact point
- **Handling Unresolved Issues**: For ambiguous questions, ask for necessary details, then template the response and incorporate it into knowledge base
> The goal is “move fast.” Keep explanations short and the next steps clear.

## Before → After (Guideline)

- **Asking around on Slack**: 5–10 min → 10–30 sec
